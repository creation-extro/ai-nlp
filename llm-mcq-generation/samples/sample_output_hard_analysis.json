      "question_stem": "Why does the requirement for 'similar types of elements' strictly limit how arrays handle mixed data?",
      "options": [
        "It prevents the array from using zero-based indexing",
        "It forces the creation of separate arrays for different data types",
        "It automatically converts floats to integers to save space",
        "It causes the array to delete the first element"

      "correct_option_index": 1,
      "correct_answer_text": "It forces the creation of separate arrays for different data types",
      "explanation": "The text explains that if you want to store floating values (different from integers), you 'must create a separate array', implying arrays cannot handle mixed types in a single structure."
